# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Image-Classification
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the classification of medical text reports, specifically focusing on brain tumor diagnoses. By processing unstructured clinical notes, pathology reports, and radiology findings, the model identifies the presence and type of brain tumors.
