# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Image-Classification
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the classification of brain MRI images, identifying the presence and type of brain tumors. By processing medical images, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, aiding healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

# Key Objectives:
- Automate Classification: Utilize CNNs to classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories.

- Enhance Diagnostic Accuracy: Reduce human error in interpreting complex medical images.

- Streamline Diagnosis Workflows: Allow clinicians and radiologists to focus on treatment rather than image analysis.

- Accelerate Treatment Planning: Provide faster and more reliable tumor detection, improving overall patient outcomes and operational efficiency

# Methodology:
- Data Preprocessing: Apply image augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.

- Model Architecture: Implement CNN-based models, such as VGG19, to extract hierarchical features from MRI images.

- Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy.
